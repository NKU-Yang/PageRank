# PageRank
Homework for Bigdata lesson in Nankai University. If you want to copy my homework, please at least give me a star!

PageRank Implemention with C++
Only used for small dataset, afterall, it is just a toy programm for homework.
But the logic and function is full enough for the pagerank algorithm.

If you want to use it for some large dataset(such as a 20G dataset). You can replace those STL container in mycode with pointer or array, which might make this programm faster. 
And you will also have to consider the partion strategy for a large dataset.
I think these are not difficult if you are familiar to C++.
